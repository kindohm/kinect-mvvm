This repo is an example of how to use Kinect skeleton tracking
(using the official Kinect SDK) within a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
pattern in WPF. The app wraps the Kinect runtime as a "service"
that is injected into the ViewModel, de-coupling the ViewModel
and View (UI) from Kinect sensor logic.
